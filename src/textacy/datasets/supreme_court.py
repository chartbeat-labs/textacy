Supreme Court decisions
-----------------------

A collection of ~8.4k (almost all) decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court
from November 1946 through June 2016 -- the "modern" era.

Records include the following data:

    - ``text``: Full text of the Court's decision.
    - ``case_name``: Name of the court case, in all caps.
    - ``argument_date``: Date on which the case was argued before the Court, as
      an ISO-formatted string ("YYYY-MM-DD").
    - ``decision_date``: Date on which the Court's decision was announced, as
      an ISO-formatted string ("YYYY-MM-DD").
    - ``decision_direction``: Ideological direction of the majority's decision:
      one of "conservative", "liberal", or "unspecifiable".
    - ``maj_opinion_author``: Name of the majority opinion's author, if available
      and identifiable, as an integer code whose mapping is given in
      :attr:`SupremeCourt.opinion_author_codes`.
    - ``n_maj_votes``: Number of justices voting in the majority.
    - ``n_min_votes``: Number of justices voting in the minority.
    - ``issue``: Subject matter of the case's core disagreement (e.g. "affirmative
      action") rather than its legal basis (e.g. "the equal protection clause"),
      as a string code whose mapping is given in :attr:`SupremeCourt.issue_codes`.
    - ``issue_area``: Higher-level categorization of the issue (e.g. "Civil Rights"),
      as an integer code whose mapping is given in :attr:`SupremeCourt.issue_area_codes`.
    - ``us_cite_id``: Citation identifier for each case according to the official
      United States Reports. Note: There are ~300 cases with duplicate ids,
      and it's not clear if that's "correct" or a data quality problem.

The text in this dataset was derived from FindLaw's searchable database of court
cases: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court.

The metadata was extracted without modification from the Supreme Court Database:
Harold J. Spaeth, Lee Epstein, et al. 2016 Supreme Court Database, Version 2016
Release 1. http://supremecourtdatabase.org. Its license is CC BY-NC 3.0 US:

This dataset's creation was inspired by a blog post by Emily Barry:
http://www.emilyinamillion.me/blog/2016/7/13/visualizing-supreme-court-topics-over-time.

The two datasets were merged through much munging and a carefully
trained model using the ``dedupe`` package. The model's duplicate threshold
was set so as to maximize the F-score where precision had twice as much
weight as recall. Still, given occasionally baffling inconsistencies in case
naming, citation ids, and decision dates, a very small percentage of texts
may be incorrectly matched to metadata. (Sorry.)
