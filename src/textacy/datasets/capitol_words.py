Capitol Words Congressional speeches
------------------------------------

A collection of ~11k (almost all) speeches given by the main protagonists of the
2016 U.S. Presidential election that had previously served in the U.S. Congress --
including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich --
from January 1996 through June 2016.

Records include the following data:

    - ``text``: Full text of the Congressperson's remarks.
    - ``title``: Title of the speech, in all caps.
    - ``date``: Date on which the speech was given, as an ISO-standard string.
    - ``speaker_name``: First and last name of the speaker.
    - ``speaker_party``: Political party of the speaker: "R" for Republican,
      "D" for Democrat, "I" for Independent.
    - ``congress``: Number of the Congress in which the speech was given: ranges
      continuously between 104 and 114.
    - ``chamber``: Chamber of Congress in which the speech was given: almost all
      are either "House" or "Senate", with a small number of "Extensions".

This dataset was derived from data provided by the (now defunct) Sunlight
Foundation's `Capitol Words API <http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/>`_.
