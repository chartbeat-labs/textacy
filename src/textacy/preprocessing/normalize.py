    Normalize unicode characters in ``text`` into canonical forms.

    Args:
        text
        form ({"NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", "NFKD"}): Form of normalization applied to
            unicode characters. For example, an "e" with accute accent "´" can be
            written as "e´" (canonical decomposition, "NFD") or "é" (canonical
            composition, "NFC"). Unicode can be normalized to NFC form
            without any change in meaning, so it's usually a safe bet. If "NFKC",
            additional normalizations are applied that can change characters' meanings,
            e.g. ellipsis characters are replaced with three periods.
