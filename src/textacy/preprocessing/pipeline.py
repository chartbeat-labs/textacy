    """
    Make a callable pipeline that takes a text as input, passes it through one or more
    functions in sequential order, then outputs a single (preprocessed) text string.

    This function is intended as a lightweight convenience for users, allowing them
    to flexibly specify which (and in which order) preprocessing functions are to be
    applied to raw texts, then treating the whole thing as a single callable.
