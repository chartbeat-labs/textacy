    Read the contents of a CSV file at ``filepath``, streaming line-by-line,
    where each line is a list of strings and/or floats whose values
    are separated by ``delimiter``.

    Args:
        filepath: Path to file on disk from which data will be read.
        encoding: Name of the encoding used to decode or encode the data in ``filepath``.
        fieldnames: If specified, gives names for columns of values,
            which are used as keys in an ordered dictionary representation
            of each line's data. If 'infer', the first kB of data is analyzed
            to make a guess about whether the first row is a header of column
            names, and if so, those names are used as keys. If None, no column
            names are used, and each line is returned as a list of strings/floats.
        dialect: Grouping of formatting parameters that determine how
            the data is parsed when reading/writing. If 'infer', the first kB
            of data is analyzed to get a best guess for the correct dialect.
        delimiter: 1-character string used to separate fields in a row.
        quoting: Type of quoting to apply to field values. See:
            https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC

    Yields:

        Dict[str, obj]: Next row, as an ordered dictionary of (key, value) pairs,
        where keys are column names and values are the corresponding strings
        and/or floats. If ``fieldnames`` is a list of column names or 'infer'
        detects a header row.
