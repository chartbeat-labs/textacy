Supreme Court Decisions
-----------------------

A collection of ~8.4k (almost all) decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court
from November 1946 through June 2016 â€” the "modern" era.

Records include the following fields:

    * ``text``: full text of the Court's decision
    * ``case_name``: name of the court case, in all caps
    * ``argument_date``: date on which the case was argued before the Court, as a
      string with format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    * ``decision_date``: date on which the Court's decision was announced, as a
      string with format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    * ``decision_direction``: ideological direction of the majority decision; either
      'conservative', 'liberal', or 'unspecifiable'
    * ``maj_opinion_author``: name of the majority opinion's author, if available
      and identifiable, as an integer code whose mapping is given in
      ``SupremeCourt.opinion_author_codes``
    * ``n_maj_votes``: number of justices voting in the majority
    * ``n_min_votes``: number of justices voting in the minority
    * ``issue``: subject matter of the case's core disagreement (e.g. affirmative
      action) rather than its legal basis (e.g. the equal protection clause),
      as a string code whose mapping is given in ``SupremeCourt.issue_codes``
    * ``issue_area``: higher-level categorization of the issue (e.g. Civil Rights),
      as an integer code whose mapping is given in ``SupremeCourt.issue_area_codes``
    * ``us_cite_id``: citation identifier for each case according to the official
      United States Reports; Note: There are ~300 cases with duplicate ids,
      and it's not clear if that's "correct" or a data quality problem

The text in this dataset was derived from FindLaw's searchable database of court
cases: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court

The metadata was extracted without modification from the Supreme Court Database:
Harold J. Spaeth, Lee Epstein, et al. 2016 Supreme Court Database, Version 2016
Release 1. http://supremecourtdatabase.org. Its license is CC BY-NC 3.0 US:

This corpus' creation was inspired by a blog post by Emily Barry:
http://www.emilyinamillion.me/blog/2016/7/13/visualizing-supreme-court-topics-over-time

NOTE: The two datasets were merged through much munging and a carefully
trained model using the ``dedupe`` package. The model's duplicate threshold
was set so as to maximize the F-score where precision had twice as much
weight as recall. Still, given occasionally baffling inconsistencies in case
naming, citation ids, and decision dates, a very small percentage of texts
may be incorrectly matched to metadata. Sorry.
