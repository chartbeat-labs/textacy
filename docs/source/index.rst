textacy: NLP, before and after spaCy
====================================

``textacy`` is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the fundamentals --- tokenization,
part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library,
``textacy`` focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.
