## textacy: NLP, before and after spaCy

`textacy` is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance `spacy` library. With the
fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. ---
delegated to another library, `textacy` focuses on the tasks that come before
and follow after.
